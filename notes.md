Webpack is a module bundler and can be extended w bundles and loaders
You can require any JS file w webpack, delegates functionality

Webpack is goated since it's REUSABLE within the same app 

***this is for later but we can require a TypeScript loader, along with SCSS, Sass, Babel, JSON, handlebars, etc.
